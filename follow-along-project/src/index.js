- Go to Google fonts and get the "Inter" font with weights 400, 600, and 700.
  Put the links to those fonts ABOVE the style.css link in index.html (Use
  the `<link/>` elements instead of the @import or npm options for getting
  the fonts. You may need to do some extra research to figure out how this 
  works if you haven't done it before)
